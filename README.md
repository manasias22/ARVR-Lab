2 Use HTC Vive/ Google Cardboard/ Google Daydream and Samsung gear VR.
3 Develop VR scene and place object
4 Work with Augmented Faces features.
Suggested Experiments: Students are required to complete at least 6 experiments.
## Sr. No. Name of the Experiment
1. Installation of Unity and Visual Studio, setting up Unity for VR development, understanding documentation of the same.

2. Demonstration of the working of HTC Vive, Google Cardboard, Google Daydream and Samsung gear VR.

3. Develop a scene in Unity that includes:
i. a cube, plane and sphere, apply transformations on the 3 game objects.
ii. add a video and audio source

4. Develop a scene in Unity that includes a cube, plane and sphere. Create a newmaterial and texture separately for three Game objects. Change the colour, material and texture of each Game object separately in the scene. Write a C# program in visual studio to change the colour and material/texture of the game objects 
dynamically on button click.

5. Develop a scene in Unity that includes a sphere and plane . Apply Rigid bodycomponent, material and Box collider to the game Objects. Write a C# program tograb and throw the sphere using vr controller.

6. Develop a simple UI(User interface ) menu with images, canvas, sprites and button.Write a C# program to interact with UI menu through VR trigger button such that on
each successful trigger interaction display a score on scene.

7. Place a three-dimensional ARCore pawn on detected AR plane surfaces

8. Using the Augmented Faces feature in your own apps.
